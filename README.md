# dichroicon-analysis

Goal is to compare the dichroicon occupancy as a funtion of reconstructed position with ratpac-two simulations for a varitey of different calibration sources. Current sources looked at
- laserball (James old code... need to get his more recent version)
- directional source (this is half-baked)
- muons (select michels)
